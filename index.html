  <h1>Architectural Intervention</h1>
  <br>
  <a align="center">
  <h2>Car Tower Project</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3> 
  <p>In relation to Assignment 2 where the amount of households with 2 cars were explored, this intervention aims to solve one of the problems which may arise due to the significant expansion.<br><br>
In the region of Parramatta in Western Sydney, a development strategy by the NSW government aims to transform the city into the central hub of Sydney. From the increased development, the city over the years have seen large expansions economically and socially bringing more employment and households to the area, hence from the previous visualisation of the database provided by ABS, it can be inferred that the  increased amount of households with 2 cars, would potentially bring issues with traffic management and parking availability. <br><br>

</p>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>The issue that the intervention would attempt to solve is traffic management and parking availability by bringing more parking zones to the area to for vehicle users and to encourage them to park into these zones for work and or/other activities to reduce the number of vehicles parked along tight and busy roads.<br><br>

To place the structure near commercial zones and public transport(Trains) in Parramatta, which are reachable within appropriate walking distance, it allows everyone to easily travel for recreation, work and transferring between modes of transportation. Therefore reducing the need for users to constantly find and park in presently congested areas and increase efficiency.
