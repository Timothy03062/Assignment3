  <h1>Architectural Intervention</h1>
  <br>
  <a align="center">
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>The inspiration of this tower came from the parking towers found in Japan and Germany to maximise space efficiency.

 Also from Global Company Amazon, which use a semi-automonous robot to transport goods throughout its warehouses. This gave inspiration to the idea of the car transportation tray.

</p>

  <h2>Strategy</h2>
  <p>The aim strategy of this project is to make an semi-automatic parking tower, to allow users to be able to park their vehicle without having to physically find spots. A central mechanic will revolve and allocate the vehicle to an availiable spot using a conveyor system, effectively reducing spot finding time.<br>
The reason behind its semi-automatic system is to allow users to still be able to walk to and from their cars even if the system is in operation, but the car itself will be locked down into the zone with limited flexibility. 
<br><br></p>

<p>When users enter the tower, an scanner will scan the number plate of the car into it database and allocate it to closet availiable spot within tower. The tower will then slot a large tray which can carry the vehicle under it and transfer it over to spot. The user(s) can then exit the vehicle and go the closet exit. 

<h3>Placement</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, structure should be placed near commercial zones and public transport(Trains) in Parramatta, which are reachable within appropriate walking distance, it allows everyone to easily travel for recreation, work and transferring between modes of transportation. Therefore reducing the need for users to constantly find and park in presently congested areas and increase efficiency. <br><br>

In realation to this, the structure is placed on Church Street, between George Street and Macquarie Street, which are within a 15 minute walking distance from the heart of the Parramatta area, close to Westfield Parramatta and Parramatta train station, hence tracing back to the original goal of easy accessibility.
